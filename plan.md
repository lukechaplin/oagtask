#What I would add as additional features if I had more time

- Create high fidelity wireframes
- Add a dark mode
- Go through plan to assess that accesbility was throughly considred: colours work for people with colour blindess/sigh difficulties, appropriate HTML tags for screen readers etc
- Think about responsiveness and how the app would look on different screeen sizes/devices
