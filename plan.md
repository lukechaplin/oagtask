#Backend Plan

- Use express generator package to create backend microservice structure for server
- Create restful API HTML routes for server that will query specific API endpoints
- These routes will include functions with specific fetch requests that will connect to the API endpoints and return relevant data
- Allow it so that certain parameters in html routes can be passed to the fetch requests so that the data linked to those parametes is returned

#What I would add as additional features if I had more time

- Create high fidelity wireframes
- Add a dark mode
- Go through plan to assess that accesbility was throughly considred: colours work for people with colour blindess/sigh difficulties, appropriate HTML tags for screen readers etc
- Think about responsiveness and how the app would look on different screeen sizes/devices
- Consider need for different language options
