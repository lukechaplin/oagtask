#Backend Plan

- Use express generator package to create backend microservice structure for server
- Create restful API HTML routes for server that will query specific API endpoints
- These routes will include functions with specific fetch requests that will connect to the API endpoints and return relevant data
- Allow it so that certain parameters in html routes can be passed to the fetch requests so that the data linked to those parameters is returned

#Frontend Plan

- Use create react app to generate basic folder structure for a react front end
- Use react router dom package to allow for different pages linked to different server HTML routes
- Write component that can be used for each page that will include input field
- Write component that will include onchange function that can be used by input field and exported to each page
- Write components for each html route that can be exported to the relevant pages that will include the option to pass the input as a parameter to the html route so this can be passed to the backend to be handled appropriately, these components will be wrapped in a useEffect
- Write functions in the above component that will be the condition the useEffects use to run contained component - in this case an onClick event

#What I would add as additional features if I had more time

- Create high fidelity wireframes
- Add a dark mode
- Go through plan to assess that accesbility was throughly considred: colours work for people with colour blindess/sigh difficulties, appropriate HTML tags for screen readers etc
- Think about responsiveness and how the app would look on different screeen sizes/devices
- Consider need for different language options
